## 🌐 Service Overview

| Service       | Description                          | Hosted At                                         |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 Gemini AI  | Resume analysis & content gen.       | Google Gemini API                                |
| 🧰 Flask API  | Extract text, generate DOCX          | Render (hidden – managed by maintainer)          |
| 🔗 Webhook    | Trigger via n8n + validate           | https://hadasbenmoshe.app.n8n.cloud/...          |


---

## 🧠 Keep Render Server Awake

To prevent delays from Render's free-tier server going to sleep, a **secondary n8n workflow** pings the Flask API every 10 minutes. This keeps the service warm and responsive at all times – even without user interaction. No external uptime monitor is needed – it's all handled serverlessly inside n8n.

---

## ⚙️ API Endpoints (For Reference)
The Flask API provides these endpoints:

You don't need to host these – already deployed.

- 'POST /extract_resume': Extracts text from uploaded resume

- 'POST /generate_docx': Generates a formatted Word document

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Webhook not working**

- Check the webhook URL in send_to_n8n.py

- Ensure n8n workflow is activated

- Verify webhook ID matches


**2. File processing errors**

- Ensure resume is in PDF or DOCX format

- Check file size limits

- Verify file is not corrupted
